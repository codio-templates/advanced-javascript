## Adding the Advanced Code Test

Adding an assessment using JSLint is added similar to other advanced code tests except for the Execution page.

### Execution

![JSLint Execution](.guides/img/jslint_execution.png)

For `LANGUAGE TYPE` select `JavaScript`. In the `LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT SUBTYPE` option, select `JSLint`. To add student code to be checked, drag the student file from the file tree to the box that says `ADD CASE`. You can type the full path to the student work if you prefer. You can add several student files to be checked. Any file added will appear below the `ADD CASE` box.
