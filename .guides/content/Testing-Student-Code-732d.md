# Testing Student Code

![Try It](.guides/img/try-it.png)

Students need the ability to run their code and check for errors prior to submitting their work for a grade. A simple button that runs the student code will allow them to see their output and check for syntax errors. This will not, however, check for the other criteria as stated in the coding exercise (one `print` statement, two variables, etc.). Here's the code to use in the Guide. Substitute in the appropriate path to the student code.

```
{try it}(node path/to/student/file.js)
```

To allow the students to fully test their code, the coding script can be linked to the `TRY IT` button. This gives the student the full feedback from the advanced code test, but it does not send a grade to the LMS. In addition, the rationale and feedback will not be shown. Here's the code to use in the Guide. Substitute in the appropriate path to the test script. **Remember**, this grading script is written in Python.

```
{try it}(python3 .guides/path/to/test/file.py)
```
