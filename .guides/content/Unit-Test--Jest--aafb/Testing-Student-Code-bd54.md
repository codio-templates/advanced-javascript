# Testing Student Code

![Try It](.guides/img/try-it.png)

Students need the ability to run their code and check their work prior to submitting their work for a grade. Link the unit test to the `TRY IT` button. This gives the student the full feedback from the unit test, but it does not send a grade to the LMS. In addition, the rationale and feedback will not be shown. The code to use in the Guide would look something like this.

```
{try it}(jest .guides/path/to/test.js --notify --config=.guides/path/to/config.json)
```
