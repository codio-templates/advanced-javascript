Follow the steps below to add an advanced code test to the Guide.

## Click the Chess Piece
Click on the chess piece to see all of the assessments that Codio provides. Select `Advanced Code Test`.

![Click Assessments](.guides/img/click-assessments.png)

## The General Section
Add a `Name` to your assessment. This will look like a "title" for the test. Leave some instructions for the student so they understand how to write their code to solve the problem.

## The Execution Section
Leave the `LANGUAGE TYPE` as `Python`. In the field `LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT SUBTYPE` select `UnitTest`. The `CASE` should be the student file to be tested. **Note**, the student file should be located in the `.guides` folder. The student code and test file need to be in the same directory. Use `python3` for the execution of the unit test, and set the working directory to `.guides/`. Toggle `ALLOW PARTIAL POINTS` if you want the question to have partial points.

## The Grading Section
If you allow partial points, enter how many total points a student can earn. If not, leave `POINTS` as `1`. Toggle `ONE ATTEMPT ONLY` if you want to restrict students to one submission. To give student rich and immediate feedback, toggle `SHOW ANSWER AND RATIONALE TO STUDENT`. Fill in the box below with a solution, and use [triple back ticks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to create a code block.

## The Metadata Section
These assessments can be added to your organization's assessment library. Filling out the `Metadata` section with tags allows you and your colleagues to search for these assessments.
