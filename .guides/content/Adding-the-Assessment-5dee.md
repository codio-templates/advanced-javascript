## The General Section
Add a `Name` to your assessment. This will look like a "title" for the test. Leave some instructions for the student so they understand how to write their code to solve the problem.

## The Execution Section
Leave the `LANGUAGE TYPE` as `custom`. In the field `COMMAND` write the command to launch your custom grading script. Toggle `ALLOW PARTIAL POINTS` if you want the question to have partial points.

## The Grading Section
If you allow partial points, enter how many total points a student can earn. If not, leave `POINTS` as `1`. Toggle `ONE ATTEMPT ONLY` if you want to restrict students to one submission. To give student rich and immediate feedback, toggle `SHOW ANSWER AND RATIONALE TO STUDENT`. Fill in the box below with a solution, and use [triple back ticks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to create a code block.
