# Previewing the HTML

Codio allows you to specify the [layout](https://docs.codio.com/common/develop/ide/workspace/panels.html#layouts) of a Guide page. This includes selecting which documents to show to students. When adding an open tab, there are several options. The default is `File`, which will open an HTML. From here, students can modify the contents of the file, but it will not show the rendered HTML. To do that, be sure to select the `Preview` option.

If students are going to do web development, it would be helpful to them to have a 3-panel or 3-column layout. Put all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in panel 0 with the type set to `File`. In panel 1, render the HTML with type `Preview`. The left side of the screen shows what this would look like in practice.
